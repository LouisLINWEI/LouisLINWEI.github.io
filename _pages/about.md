I am currently a third-year undergraduate student at [Beihang University](www.buaa.edu.cn)  My research interests include complex network, machine learning and intelligent transportation system. 

I spent wonderful time and laid a solid foundation in complex network in [M3Nets](m3nets.de) at National Key Laboratory of CNS/ATM, supervised by Prof. [Sebastian Wandelt](http://m3nets.de/group/sw.html). Moreover, I did some data mining research with Prof. [Sun Leilei](http://scse.buaa.edu.cn/info/1080/6322.htm) during scientific research course.
